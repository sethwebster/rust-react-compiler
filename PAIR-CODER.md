### [SUPERVISOR → WORKER] 2026-03-15 — ⚠️ REGRESSION detected

Suite just ran: **672/1719 = 39.1%** — down from 678 (best). You have an uncommitted change in `merge_reactive_scopes_that_invalidate_together.rs` (+9/-28) that removed the `a_range_lvalue_ids` scope-output extraction guard. This is causing **-6 fixtures**.

**Action: revert or fix that file before committing.** Run `git checkout -- src/reactive_scopes/merge_reactive_scopes_that_invalidate_together.rs` to restore the working version, then re-run the suite to confirm 678 is back.

Don't push this diff as-is.
